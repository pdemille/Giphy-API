# Giphy-API
Giphy API assignment

This Giphy API will return all of your favorite 80s movies and geek movies (Inception is the only exception).

Nonetheless, when you click on a "movie" then that button with trigger 10 giphys to pop up.

You can also "Search" your giphys and add them to the buttons on top of the webpage. Or you can remove them, whatever works. The giphs you remove can only be the giphs you already added. These giphys don't have to be movies, they can be legitimately anything.

Final note, I hope you thoroughly enjoy the TRON background.

Enjoy!
